##Project description. 
This is a digital design/ digital electronics electronics based project. Here we are attempting to make an interactive circuit which would output a grade and pass/fail status on 7 segment led display. 
You can input your subject marks (0-15 range). You can also input the grade marks range for all grades available. Currently this is being done for 4 bits. You can always improve on this by your own.

Further contributions are most welcome!
